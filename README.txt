Welcome to the Pechanga Employee Directory.

>>>>>>>>>>
For proper use with the PHP files, please ensure the following is set up: 
 - Make sure you have PHP installed on your computer.
 - In the file 'php.ini', have the line 'extension=pdo_sqlite' uncommented (remove the ';' in front).
 - In the main directory with the file 'pechanga_directory_main_page.html', open up the Command Line (cmd) or navigate to it in CMD.
 - In CMD, type 'php -S localhost:1234' to set up a host server to run the PHP pages.
<<<<<<<<<<

Feel free to navigate through the different departments listed to view their current employees.

The Pechanga logo on the top left is clickable and leads to the Pechanga main website.

The administrative login on the main page leads to a page where you must log in in order to add, edit, or delete employee records throughout the company.

Employee names and details in the database are for test purposes.

Login credentials are for test purposes and are as such at this time:
 - Username: admin; Password: admin
 - Username: jerry; Password: jerry

The 'password_hash.php' file in Supplementary Files can be used to generate a new hashed password for the database.

Please ensure that each department has a Vice President, Director, Assistant Director, Manager, Assistant Manager, Supervisor, and at least 1 Employee.
